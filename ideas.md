Build something that you find interesting.

This probably isn't a project that will make its way onto your portfolio or resume, but it's still good to get into the habit of building things that are interesting and useful. Interesting and useful projects have many benefits:

They're more fun to work on
They have more interesting and difficult problems to solve
You (or someone else) might actually use them
They're more likely to grab the attention of other people
Attention from other people can lead to career opportunities
How do I choose an idea?
Use a programming language that you're already at least somewhat familiar with. Assuming you haven't been writing a ton of code outside of Boot.dev, your project should probably be a Python program that runs on the command line. That's fine!

I want to provide a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing, but please don't choose a project from this list without at least putting your own spin on it

A text-based adventure game in the terminal
A CLI tool to detect the strength of a password, or to validate it
Tic-Tac-Toe in a tkinter GUI
A tool that creates ASCII art from an image
A command line tool to view Reddit feeds in the terminal
A command line tool that parses a CSV file of pokemon data and lets you search for pokemon by name, type, etc.
